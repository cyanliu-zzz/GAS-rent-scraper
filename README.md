# GAS rent scraper
A Google Apps Script to be implemented inside this goofy Google Sheets spreadsheet I've been using to keep track of rent prices in Minneapolis. Ideally, this would run on a daily basis and update with any changes to apartment prices or something like that. The post-college apartment hunt has been...interesting to say the least. 


## Usage
This particular application is rather specific to the apartment spreadsheet I've been using, but it is fairly customizable! [This is an example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10XwfwejuwCKB7JiM_YyK_-FwFdr8yw9PGdCpTNa_M3c/edit?usp=sharing) of my spreadsheet's setup.

As of right now, the script depends on these key factors:
 * A sheet titled "apartments"
 * A column of hyperlinked text that corresponds to a given apartment's floorplan page (or some other similar page that lists the cost of rent)
 * A separate sheet titled "output"
 
 
## TO DO:
 * uhhhh
